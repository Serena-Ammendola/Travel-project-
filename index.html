            largest in
            Europe, has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
          <p>
            Naples is famous for its pizza and gastronomy, it is famous for its landscapes and nature, for lying at the
            foot
            of
            Vesuvius, an active volcano, but its geographical location makes it an ideal point for exploring both the
            Sorrento coast
            and the Gulf Islands.
