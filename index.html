          <h2>Why Naples?</h2>
          <h3>Naples, the city of a thousand colors</h3>
          <p>Naples is famous for multiple aspects that make it a unique and fascinating city, first and foremost for
            its
            history and
            culture.Founded by the Greeks in the 18th century B.C., it boasts a history of thousands of years with a
            succession of
            dominations leaving a priceless legacy of monuments, works of art and traditions. Its historic center, the
            largest in
            Europe, has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
          <p>
            Naples is famous for its pizza and gastronomy, it is famous for its landscapes and nature, for lying at the
            foot
            of
            Vesuvius, an active volcano, but its geographical location makes it an ideal point for exploring both the
            Sorrento coast
            and the Gulf Islands.

            Naples is famous for its Neapolitans, known for their hospitality, warmth and liveliness. Naples has given
            birth
            to
            great artists, musicians and composers such as Caravaggio, Totò, Enrico Caruso, Lucio Dalla, Pino Daniele,
            Massimo
            Troisi and many others...</p>
